**************************
*scout_webots_sim* package
**************************
This package provides the tools for a high level interface with the Scout platform in the Webots simulated environment. The tools provided are mainly:

#. A simulated world with the Scout model loaded inside

#. A ROS node that interfaces between ROS and the Scout model in Webots 

#. SDK for adding peripheral to the Scout model in Webots.



* Start the Webots-based simulation of the Scout platform:

    .. code-block:: none

        $ roslaunch scout_webots_sim scout_v2_sim_basic.launch


    This will:

    #. Launch Webots
    
    #. Load a simple world with the scout robot in it

   
* Next, the ROS node interfaces ROS with the Scout model in Webots can be launched:

    .. code-block:: none

        $ roslaunch scout_webots_sim scout_v2_sim_node_basic


    In the Webots console, the message :code:`The controller is now connected to the ROS master` should be displayed.
    
    This will start the */scout_webots_node* that

    * Subscribes:

      * /cmd_vel

      * /scout_light _control

      * /model_name

    * Publishes:

      * /odom

      * /tf        
    
    Through this node, the Scout model can be controller using the /cmd_vel topic.

* Start the keyboard tele-op node

    .. code-block:: none

        $ roslaunch scout_bringup scout_teleop_keyboard.launch


In the *scout_nav_bringup* the launch file: *scout_sim_basic_full.launch* will launch all 3 launch files above as well as the scout_description.launch.
