*************************

Form the previous instruction, multiple instances of the terminal would be required to launch all the individual launch files. The scout_nav_bringup package provides launch files that consolidate different launch files:

scout_v2_sim_nav_platform_full.launch
=====================================

#. Launches `scout_v2_sim_nav_platform.launch`: Runs Webots and start ROS node to interface LiDAR, IMU and Scout in webots with ROS

#. Launches `scout_v2_nav_platform_description.launch`: Publishes transformed between links in the robot

#. Launches `scout_teleop_keyboard.launch`: Control Scout in Webots using keyboard.

#. Runs `pointcloud_to_laserscan` node that condenses 3D pointcloud into 2D scan for gmapping

scout_v2_sim_mapping.launch
===========================

#. Launches `scout_v2_sim_nav_platform_full.launch`

#. Launches `scout_v2_mapping.launch`

scout_v2_sim_navigation.launch
==============================

#. Launches `scout_v2_sim_nav_platform_full.launch`

#. Launches `scout_v2_navigation.launch`

scout_v2_robot_mapping.launch
=============================

#. Launches `scout_base.launch`: Setup communication between onboard PC and Scout

#. Launches `scout_v2_nav_platform_description.launch`: Publishes transformed between links in the robot

#. Launches `scout_v2_mapping.launch`

scout_v2_robot_navigation.launch
================================

#. Launches `scout_base.launch`: Setup communication between onboard PC and Scout

#. Launches `scout_v2_nav_platform_description.launch`: Publishes transformed between links in the robot

#. Launches `scout_v2_navigation.launch`

scout_v2_workstation_mapping.launch
===================================

#. Runs RVIZ using a preset configuration to display pointcloud, laserscan, mapping and transforms

scout_v2_workstation_navigation.launch
======================================

#. Runs RVIZ using a preset configuration to display pointcloud, laserscan, mapping and transforms

Sample Usage 
============

An example usage of these launch files is as described below:

#. launch scout_v2_robot_mapping.launch & launch lslidar_c16.launch on the onboard pc

#. launch scout_v2_workstation_mapping.launch on the workstation.

#. launch scout_teleop_keyboard.launch to control the robot

#. Move the robot around and map the area it is in
