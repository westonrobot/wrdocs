Hunter CAN/Serial Interface
===========================
The CAN/Serial interface translates data between CAN/SerialAN Frames and Hunter data types. There are two main data types:

1. HunterState: Data received from the embedded controller that indicates the current status of the Hunter 
are converted form a CAN Frame/Serial input and stored as a this C++ data structure

2. HunterMotionCmd: C++ data structure that encapsulates motion control data of Hunter. 
The data is then translated to a CAN Frame/Serial output compatible to Hunter control



Notably, the CAN interface will store the last received motion cmd from the higher level (ROS Interface) 
and continuously output the cmd (as a CAN Frame)
to the Hunter at a fixed rate of 50kHz. 
If this stream of CAN Frames being sent to the embedded controller on the Hunter is stopped, the Hunter will stop moving
