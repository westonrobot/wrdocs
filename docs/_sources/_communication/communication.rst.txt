Introduction: ROS to CAN/Serial interface
=========================================
This segment runs throughs the interface between ROS messages and low level communications (CAN / Serial)

The conversion from ROS message to CAN frame occurs in two main steps as shown in the flow chart.

Moving down the flow chart:

1. The ROS interface will create a node that listens for ROS messages of a specified ROS topic. 

2. The information in the ROS message will be translated into a platform-unique C++ data structure known as a *Platform Command*. 

3. The Basic Operation package contains the subroutines required to translate these platform into CAN frames. 

4. Furthermore, the package handles the communication of the CAN frame through the CAN bus.

Moving up the flow chart:
1. The Basic Operations Interface will also contain the subroutines required to read the CAN frames and translate them 
into platform-unique *Platform Messages*. 

2. These messages can then be translated into ROS messages by the ROS interface. 

3. The ROS interface will also handle publishing of these messages to the appropriate ROS topic. 




CAN/Serial Interface
====================

CAN Interface
-------------
Information on CAN bus can be found in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqLDpHsxvf8 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus.

Many protocols for communication through the CAN bus is similar for different platforms. 
As such, a abstract class `MobileBase` was designed as the super class of the CAN interface class for each robot model.

On the level of `MobileBase` the following is handled:

1. Setting up CAN connection
2. Disconnecting CAN connection 
3. Maintaining stream of CAN Frames

Enabling CAN communication
--------------------------
If the computer you are using contains a physical CAN bus, communication via CAN bus should be simple.
Otherwise, a USB to CAN adaptor can be used. Is a USB to CAN adaptor is used, the follwing commands are required::

$ sudo modprobe gs_usb
$ sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000


Starting CAN connection
-------------------------
During the setting up of CAN connection, the protocol used to read the CAN Frame will be set. 
Since each platform will process CAN Frames differently, each platform will write its own ParseCANFrame(can_frame *rx_frame) function. 
The calling 

To ensure the safe operation of the robot, the robots requires a steady stream of commands from the computer.
This is to ensure that if communication is lost, the robot would not be stuck executing the previously sent command, 
and instead the robot will stop moving.

Maintaining stream of CAN Frames
--------------------------------
The control of this continuous stream of CAN Frames is handled by the::
   `void MobileBase::ControlLoop(int32_t period_ms)` 

in the MobileBase class. However, the types CAN Frames varies between robots. 
Therefore, the actual function designed to send each message is determined by each platform in the `SendRobotCmd()` function
i.e. Each platform designs is CAN Frame sending protocol while the MobileRobot abstract class maintains the loop.

Disconnecting CAN connection 
----------------------------


Testing CAN connection
----------------------

After connecting the robot and the computer via the CAN bus, an additional device should show up from the commands::

   $ ifconfig -a

The new device should be identified as:: 

   can#: flags=.....

whereby # is a number, usually # = 0. For the segments below, it is assumed that the connection occurs at can0.
If this occurs, it indicates that the computer is actually connected to the robot via the CAN bus. 
You can attempt to read the data being sent via the CAN bus using:: 

   $ candump can0

If the comuunication is working properly, a stream of hexamdeximal should be flooding the command line. If instead the message:: 

   read: Network is down 

is shown, it indicates that TODO: not sure exactly what is indicates::

   $ sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000

could fix this issue
